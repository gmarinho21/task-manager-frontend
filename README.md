# TASG - Task Manager

This is the frontend for personal project where i can test the tech I'm learning.
The backend utilizes node API to send requests to a mongoDB where all the information is stored.
This is a work in progress.

There's a live version at tasg.gabriel.com.br

## What is TASG?

TASG is a task list and planner where you can separate the tasks between projects.

I use this project to test new libraries and ideas.

## How to run?

Clone the Repository, then:

```
   cd task-manager-frontend
   npm run dev
```

Note: For this to run correctly, you'll will also need to run de backend AND setup a MongoDB instance
